# Sinonimi
This is a simple tool (in the form of a web page), to help people finding synonyms and antonyms for the Italian language.
This first version is built with Italian in mind, but it could be easily adapted to other languages as well, please open an [issue](https://github.com/ildede/sinonimi/issues) (or a [PR](https://github.com/ildede/sinonimi/pulls)) if you need it!
And if you don't know how to do it: [i'm here](https://bit.ly/m/pedron-dev)!
